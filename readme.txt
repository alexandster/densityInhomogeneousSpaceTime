spatiotemporal indexing

Assume a regularly spaced 3D (spacetime) grid of points. Choose a query point, a neighbor degree, and find neighboring grid points.

Should be ultimately used to accelerate ST K function and STKDE.

test2.py is the latest version of a simple script that performs indexing
ST_IB.py is a work in progress for adaptive STKDE
